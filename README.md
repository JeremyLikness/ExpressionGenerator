# ExpressionGenerator

This example parses a JSON file to dynamically build a LINQ predicate that can be used to filter objects.

To get started, simply clone and run. Make sure one of the `.json` source files is in your current directory (this is done automatically from Visual Studio). Each project has its own copy.

The `ExpressionGenerator` project can be set as startup for LINQ to Objects.

The `DatabaseTest` will apply the expressions to a locally created SQLite database.
